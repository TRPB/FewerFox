# FewerFox

FewerFox is a `userChrome.css` that gives Firefox a very minimal UI. The navigation bar and tab bar are combined into one line and all navigation bar buttons are hidden until you mouse over them.

## Installation

1. Enable `userChrome.css` as described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/wiki/userchrome#wiki_1._enable_userchrome_customisation_in_about.3Aconfig)

2. Use the `userChrome.css` from this repository.


## Known bugs

1. The right click menu causes the address bar to expand: See #1

2. Non-HTTPs URLs are partially obscured (WIP, this should be fixable)
